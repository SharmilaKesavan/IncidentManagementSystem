# Requirements:

## Introduction
     
        Incident Mangement System is similar to ticket raising portal .If the user wants a software to be installed or any other query to be resolved ,then 
        user can use this portal.
    
## Cost and Future Scope and Timeline
       
  ### i) 10 years ago :
                 There were no applications to raise a ticket and resolve the problem.
                 
  ### ii) Present Generation.
                For all IT companies they have their own platform to raise the ticket  and resolve it virtually. 
                    
 ## Defining about application
 
          Basic operations of ticket raising portal is clearly done, User login and admin login is included separately. 
          
 # SWOT Analysis
  
  ## i) Strength 
             Easily user can raise a ticket, and admin can update and view the status of tickets raised .
             
             
 ## ii) Weakness 
            Only basic type of issues are included .
            
## iii) Opportunity
             We can also standardize the ticket menus and can include and explore new types of query by making sub-category.
             
## iv) Threats 
           If there is any disconnectivity with databse ,the portal will not reflect any changes.
